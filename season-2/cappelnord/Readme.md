# A stochastic improvisation with fungal textures

## What you will need

* [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) + [sc3-plugins](http://supercollider.github.io/sc3-plugins/)
* A clone of the [mushroom-clouds](https://github.com/cappelnord/mushroom-clouds) repository as a subfolder in this folder

## How to run the code

* Open mc-behind-the-screens.scd
* Execute the lines/brackets one after another. The last line (with ~runAgents) should start the music. You can now change the agents code while the piece is running.

## I want the visualizer as well

* Open mc-init.scd and uncomment the two lines under VISUALIZER
* Open MushroomCloudsViz in Processing
* Run code as explained above
