# [Jobi](https://jokroese.com) 10-minute Live Coding Challenge

I used [TidalCycles](tidalcycles.org/) and [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) for the audio and [Hydra](https://hydra-editor.glitch.me/) for the visuals.

## Guide to the Samples Used

I am slightly wary of the legal implications of hosting some of the samples in this repository. Instead, here's a guide to them.

- `goldeneye`: sounds from James Bond Goldeneye PS1 game.
- `ff1`: sounds from [Final Fantasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_(video_game)). I think the ones used in this set were from the 2004 Game Boy Advance release.
- `more`: backing vocals from Britney Spears' [Gimme More](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elueA2rofoo).
- `freak-vocals`: the vocal track of Missy Elliot's [Get Ur Freak On](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPoKiGQzbSQ).
- `i-wud-never`: vocal track from 100 Gecs' [xXXi_wud_nvrstøp_ÜXXx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAjveYLtHQ).
- `hard`: a hardcore style kick coded in SuperCollider that was based on [snappizz](http://sccode.org/snappizz)'s [gabber](http://sccode.org/1-5aV).
