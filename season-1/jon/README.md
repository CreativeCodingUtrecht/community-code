# Instructions...

To run this code you need a few extensions from the SC community.

* MarkovSet and MarkovSetN found in the MathLib quark
  https://github.com/supercollider-quarks/MathLib

* JPverb found in the SC3 Community Plugins
  https://supercollider.github.io/sc3-plugins/

Before starting I trained some Markov Chains on the first few bars of a
hymn from [The Sacred Harp](http://originalsacredharp.com/). This code can
be found in 10minute_plumbing.scd ~ along with some of the SynthDefs I use to
do livecoding.
